# ADVANCE BINARY CALCULATOR

This repository consists of the source code of python with some snapshot or video.

## How it is done?
So basically, when I was in the 2nd semester there was a subject called **DIGITAL ELECTRONICS**. In this subject, there is a lot of mathematical calculations in binary format. At that time I and my friends were facing very problems. As we all know our 2nd sem was gone in online because of COVID-19. So our college faculty just teach all students then he gives assignment question for practice. When we are done with the assignment. I thought I want to cross my answers with my friends. But at the time of discussion everyone's answers come differently. So in online classes, we do have not enough time for discussion. For this, our doubts were not clear correctly.

So my friend said we are making a BINARY CALCULATOR for solving this problem. At the time of making this calculator project, we both are facing so many problems we both are giving our 100% for this project. When we get stuck in problems to resolve the problem we are using so many resources to solve the problem.

In the end, I and my friend Prince Singh finally did this project.

## About our project

Language and Tools: Python, For GUI (Tkinter, it is the standard GUI library for Python)

This project are totally depend on binary format. We can use this project for binary mathematical operation.

The tasks performed by this project :- 
1. Conversions
     - Decimal Conversion
     - Binary Conversion
     - Octal Conversion
     - Hexa-Decimal Conversion
     
2. Binary Operation
     - Addition
     - Subtraction
     - Multiplication
     - Division
3. 1' & 2's complement
4. Binary Encryption and Decryption
5. Bitwise Operator
6. Binary left and right shift
